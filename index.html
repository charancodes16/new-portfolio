        <p class="about-charan-1">
            <span class="sentence-1">Charan was born in India in 2002. He's a product designer currently based in India.</span>
            <span class="sentence-2">Currently, he is pursuing a pre-final year in Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at</span>
            <span> Kumaraguru college of Technology in Coimbatore, India.</span>
            <span class="sentence-3">Charan is interested in <span class="design-think">&nbsp;Design thinking, innovations, idea, product and human psychology.</span> &nbsp;His</span> 
            <span>vision is to build great products for the human experience. Designing for everyone creating </span>
            <span>solutions for people while interacting with products. He believes in solving problems to improve</span>
            <span>people‚Äôs lives via design for the human experience.</span>
            <span class="sentence-4">He has worked for companies like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freecharge.in" target="_blank" id="freecharge">Freecharge.</a></span>
        </p>
        <p class="about-charan-2">
            <span class="sentence-1 POV">His POV on design</span>
            <span class="sentence-2">Designing products to make a better world for human experiences. Good design comes not only</span> 
            <span>in UI phase its all about end-to-end product aspects. Everyone in the world sees design in the</span>
            <span>visual phase. Design is all about the experience. How the people feel about the product while</span> 
            <span>having interactions. It matters the way sensory stimuli act on the interfaces on the screen.</span> 
            <span><span class="design-think">‚ÄúDesign is not about how it looks it‚Äôs all about How it works‚Äù.</span>&nbsp;Humans have emotions that tap</span>
            <span>into deep emotions that we need to use responsibly.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="about-charan-3">
            <span class="his-work">So, how did he actually works</span>
            <span class="sentence-2">Building a bridge between work and the Learning curve? He put lots of effort into work. He</span>
            <span>believes in Discipline, Honest, and Interest. Surely, It gives more than what you think. So, the</span> 
            <span>learning curve always follows everywhere in design and life. He is a deep observer. While,</span> 
            <span>observing taught him many things like confidence, patience, success, and failures.</span>
            <span class="sentence-3">As a designer to solve people and business problems and improve the product, market fit</span> 
            <span>balance, and business needs. Like, it all comes from a blank space so it all settles as a solution.</span> 
            <span>Keeps on saying that go from the root of a problem as much as possible. So, why it matters is</span> 
            <span>good design wants to reach at the end of the day we are using the products in some of the hard</span>
            <span>situations to onboard our tasks on small to big screens. Always he goes to the next ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù</span>
            <span>and ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù?. So, It gives a solution and useful products liked by people in the world. </span>
            <span class="sentence-4">His process flow is he always organizes his work to sync into learning and productivity. And</span>
            <span>gives more importance to priority works, creating concepts to understand easily, he always does</span> 
            <span>research before stepping into a problem for outcomes, documenting every pain point, and</span>
            <span>creating options. So if ‚ÄòA‚Äô doesn‚Äôt work will go for ‚ÄòB‚Äô. If ‚ÄòB‚Äô also doesn‚Äôt work go for C, D, E, F, and it</span>
            <span>goes on.</span>
